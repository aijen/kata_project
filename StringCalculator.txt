StringCalculator

1) Create a simple String calculator with a method int add (string numbers)
•	The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum.
•	An empty string it will return 0.
•	Example inputs :  "" or "1" or "1,2"

2) Allow the add() method to handle an unknown amount of arguments/numbers.

3) Allow the add() method to handle new lines between numbers instead of commas.
The following input is ok: 1\n2,3, the result is 6.
The following input is NOT ok: 1,\n

4) Support different delimiters.
To change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]"
Example :  "//;\n1;2" should return 3, the default delimiter is ;.
The first line is optional, all existing scenarios (using , or \n) should work as before

5) Calling add() with a negative number will throw an exception "Négatives not allowed" listing all negtive numbers that were in the list of numbers.
Example: "-1,2" throws "Negatives not allowed : -1"
Example : "2,-4,3,-5" throws "Negatives not allowed : -4,-5"

6) Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored
Example : "1001,2" returns 2
